## Presentation Topics

1. Green threads/processes (e.g. Go goroutines & Erlang processes) vs Kernel threads/processes
1. Concurrency control: Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
1. ACID (Atomicity/Consistency/Isolation/Durability) vs BASE (Basically Available/Soft state/Eventually consistent) databases
1. Message Passing vs Shared Memory models: Contrast the two concurrency models, discussing communication mechanisms, scalability, and suitability for various parallel computing tasks.
1. HTTP versions
1. Unique identifiers in distributed computing: Snowflake IDs, UUIDs, etc.
1. Event ordering in distributed systems: Lamport clocks & Vector clocks
1. Distributed System Design Patterns: Orchestration vs Choreography
