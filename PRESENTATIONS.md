## Presentation Topics

- Green threads/processes (e.g. Go goroutines & Erlang processes) vs Kernel threads/processes
- Concurrency control: Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
- ACID (Atomicity/Consistency/Isolation/Durability) vs BASE (Basically Available/Soft state/Eventually consistent) databases
- Message Passing vs Shared Memory models: Contrast the two concurrency models, discussing communication mechanisms, scalability, and suitability for various parallel computing tasks.
- HTTP Evolutions: HTTP/1 vs HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3
- Unique identifiers in distributed computing: Snowflake IDs, UUIDs, etc.
- Event ordering in distributed systems: Lamport clocks & Vector clocks
- Distributed System Design Patterns: Orchestration vs Choreography
- Distributed Transactions: 2PC/3PC
- Consensus algorithms: Raft vs Paxos
